# KnucklesMod
Adds a Knuckles item as a collectible scrap in the game.

This is an overwhelmingly simple mod, but still, here are some improvements I may make in the future:

- Change item propertes (weight, rarity, value, etc.)
- Add / alter audio

Knuckles gives players an advantage with enemy detection. Knuckles will alert you to nearby enemies with a helpful voiceline while being held.

This mod can only be considered NSFW because of a voiceline I recorded. I may change this in the future to increase visibility.

I DO NOT own this Knuckles asset, I found it here: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ugandan-knuckles-d6d71193eaf7498e81d84ec10eb2b576 credit goes to wardd on Sketchfab.

Feel free to contact me for any suggestions or bug reports.
